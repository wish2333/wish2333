### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am wish.

Since 2021, as a student of the School of Journalism at the Communication University of China, I have been dedicated to integrating the enthusiasm for social service, the theoretical knowledge of communication studies, and the practical production of new media, devoting myself to the cause of Marxism and socialism with Chinese characteristics.

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in spatial sociology and rural cultural tourism communication, conducting corresponding social surveys and scientific research. I engaged in both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms, employing methods such as field research and in-depth interviews, as well as machine learning and time series analysis. Two related papers were included and presented at the 30th Annual Conference of the Center for Media Information and Communication.

In my new media practice, I have accumulated rich practical experience in empowering new media operations and content production using Python.
