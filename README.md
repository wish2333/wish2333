### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am wish.

Since 2021, as a student of the School of Journalism at the Communication University of China, I have focused on combining a strong enthusiasm for social service, theoretical knowledge of communication studies, and the production practices of new media to dedicate myself to the cause of Marxism and socialism with Chinese characteristics.

During my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong interest in spatial sociology and online public opinion, which led me to conduct corresponding social investigations and scientific research. I fully practiced quantitative and qualitative research paradigms, using methods such as field surveys and in-depth interviews, machine learning and time series analysis, respectively. I possess the ability to use Python for tasks such as data visualization, text analysis, text clustering, text classification, and text summarization. Two related papers were included and presented at the 30th Annual Conference of the Center for Media Information and Communication. My undergraduate thesis, "Breaking Interaction Boundaries: A Social Simulation Study of the Diffusion of Technological Innovation in College Student Groups Using Large Models," is currently being written.

In media practice, I have accumulated extensive development experience in using Python to empower new media content production and build AI applications. I am also proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling me to build basic new media pages.

In my master's program, I will begin my studies in sociology.
